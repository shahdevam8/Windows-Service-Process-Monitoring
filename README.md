# Windows Service & Process Monitoring Agent

## Project Overview

This project develops a **Windows Service & Process Monitoring Agent** capable of detecting malicious, unauthorized, or suspicious process behavior. The framework monitors service configurations, process hierarchies, startup entries, and runtime activity to identify anomalies.

### Features

* Real-time monitoring of Windows processes and services
* Detection of suspicious parent-child process relationships
* Startup service auditing
* Unauthorized process detection
* Alerts and detailed logging
* GUI dashboard to view logs and status

## Practical Motivation

Monitoring Windows services and processes helps detect:

* Malware activity
* Intrusion attempts
* Privilege escalation
* Persistence mechanisms

## Objectives

1. Monitor active Windows processes and analyze parent-child behavior.
2. Audit startup services for suspicious or modified services.
3. Detect unauthorized or unknown processes.
4. Generate alerts based on rule-based or behavior-based triggers.
5. Produce detailed reports summarizing anomalies and threats.

## Folder Structure

```
WindowsMonitorAgent/
├── monitor.py           # Main monitoring script
├── gui.py               # GUI dashboard implementation
├── config/
│   ├── whitelist.json   # Allowed processes
│   └── blacklist.json   # Blocked processes
├── logs/                # Log files generated by the agent
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

## Tools & Technologies

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: psutil, wmi, tkinter (for GUI), win32api, win32con
* Optional: PowerShell commands for extended service monitoring

## How It Works

1. Enumerates active Windows processes and services.
2. Builds a parent-child process tree.
3. Audits startup services and configurations.
4. Detects unauthorized or suspicious processes.
5. Logs events and generates alerts.
6. Displays real-time data on a GUI dashboard.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Whitelist/Blacklist

* `config/whitelist.json`: Add allowed processes.
* `config/blacklist.json`: Add blocked or suspicious processes.

### 3. Run Monitoring Agent

```bash
python monitor.py
```

* The agent will start real-time monitoring.
* Logs will be generated in the `logs/` folder.
* GUI dashboard will display current processes and alerts.

### 4. Review Logs

* Logs contain timestamp, process name, PID, path, and alert type.
* Review logs for suspicious activity and anomalies.

## Expected Output

* Alerts for suspicious processes or startup services.
* Real-time GUI reflecting process and service status.
* Detailed logs and summary report.

## Learning Outcomes

* Understanding Windows process architecture and service internals.
* Real-time monitoring techniques for SOC and incident response.
* Rule-based detection logic and alerting.
* Defensive security engineering practices.
